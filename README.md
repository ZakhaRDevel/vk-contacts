# VkContacts

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

### Static build for GitHub Pages

To build a static version for GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run build:static
```

## Deployment

2. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
3. Select "GitHub Actions" as source
4. The site will be automatically deployed on each push to `main` branch

npm run deploy
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md](./GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md).

## Running unit tests
